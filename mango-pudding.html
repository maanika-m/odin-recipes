        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Hong Kong-style mango pudding is a classic dim sum or yum cha dessert! It's made with fresh, ripe mangoes and evaporated milk for a super creamy texture.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100 g cold water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gelatin powder</li>
            <li>450 g fresh, ripe mangoes</li>
            <li>350 g evaporated milk
            <li>100 g granulated sugar</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>

         <li>In a small bowl of cold water. Sprinkle gelatin powder over the surface and let sit for 5 minutes until the gelatin blooms and becomes a gel consistency.</li>

         <li>In a blender, blend mangoes until smooth. If your mangoes were fibrous and stringy, strain the purée through a fine mesh sieve before using.</li>

         <li>Pour the mango purée into a small pot. Add evaporated milk and granulated sugar. Stir to mix well.</li>

         <li>Add the bloomed gelatin puck. Transfer the pot to the stovetop.</li>

         <li>Heat the mango mixture on low-medium heat until the gelatin has completely dissolved, stirring occasionally. Don't let the mixture boil as high heat will destroy the proteins in gelatin and prevent it from setting. You only want to warm it enough until it has dissolved.</li>

         <li>Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly before pouring it into serving cups or bowls.</li>

         <li>Chill the pudding cups in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight until set. Serve with more mango chunks and evaporated milk.</li>
